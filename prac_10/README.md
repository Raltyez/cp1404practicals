# Reflection
1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during 
the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?

I suppose my accuracy for the entire estimates for the practicals is somewhat alright. But during the practicals over
time, I felt like I may have slowly losing my accuracy. These estimates have made me understand where I lack and how I
can improve.

2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

Doing these code reviews helped me that the principles are really important as it really makes the code clean easier to
read as a reviewer. It really helps it out with other programmers that we can be aligned and understand what their
project is about.

3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add an explanation on how the code works, especially prac 8 with Kivy where relying on the example
can sometimes bring out some questions
