# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Repository owned by Ralph

This repo is practical work for IT@JCU CP1404.
I am an Indonesian who likes to juggle video games as if I am tourist.

The three main lessons that I learned for a clean code are:
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY in short)
- Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP in short)
- Making sure the process is logically correct

The instructions for the practicals is [Here](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/tree/master) and 
here's a [guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) for programming patterns.
